### Project Background

I created this basic application as an introduction to Vue.js. It is designed to have the basic functionality of other thesaurus applications where a user can enter a term to search for synonyms and can also discover new synoyms by clicking on any of the displayed words. This project was assigned as a way to take on the challenge of learning a new technology in just a few days.
